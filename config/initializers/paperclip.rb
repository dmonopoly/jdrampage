# Nothing is needed here if you are running on your Windows computer.

# The following is for your Ubuntu 10.04.
# Oddly, it does not work, although "which identify" yields "/usr/local/bin/identify"
# :image_magick_path is deprecated - used :command_path. still no good.
# Paperclip.options[:command_path] = "/usr/local/bin"

# For now, only use your Windows to deal with images b/c it doesn't work on your Ubuntu.
