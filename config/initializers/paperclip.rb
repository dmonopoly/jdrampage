# Nothing is needed here is running on your Windows.

# The following is for your Ubuntu 10.04.
# Oddly, it does not work, although "which identify" yields "/usr/local/bin/identify"
# Paperclip.options[:command_path] = "/usr/local/bin/"

# For now, only use your Windows to deal with images b/c it doesn't work on your Ubuntu.
