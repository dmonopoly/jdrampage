Online student newspaper for JDHS
Uses Rails 3.0.3
*Yet to be deployed*

Important ideas:
-Section and free space names never change.
-The author column for articles is for previews and should be succinct like "John Wood and Jeremy Lin"
    o It is optional at the moment; if it is present, it will be shown ("By"); otherwise, it will not be shown (no "By").
-The credits column for articles is for articles/show. It is of type text because it contains multiple lines.

Issues:
-truncating teasers / beginnings of articles could cut right into html tags (leading to unbalanced html tags)
-article previews are not robustly shown so the perfect spacing is determined between previews.

--TODO/Ideas--
Prioritized
-transfer database content
-how do people unsubscribe?
    o they would have to email a moderator on the staff to unsubscribe
-sorting problem: conflicts with paginate...
	o if you go to a page > 1 and sort, the section_positions get screwed up
	  b/c they are based on the indices in the array
	o You have fixed move_to_top_in_section :]

-testing

Unorganized
-may not need to show teaser in medium & large previews *
-only OLD articles in sidebars
-change things that are unnecessarily :text to :string (i.e. teaser)

-sidebar reload AJAX
-comments

Accomplished
-deal with subscribers
-pagination
	o for sections show, articles appear and it is all good.
	o consider some "show more" thing later so no sorting issues...
-sort functionality within scope of section, so you can order articles within a section / most recent = 1st
	o accomplish this by creating a section_position:integer column in the articles table
	o a newly created article should have this variable be 1, +1 to others
-show most recent articles in sections first
-free space for sections
		o get styles working... only inline styles allowed, actually.
-nice design (improve sidebar, look & feel, ckeditor)
		o use content_for to clean up layout
		o sidebar for the back
-types of accounts:
    o see notes in dropbox. use cancan gem of ryanb
-decide what you want on the back home. For now, it is just a redundant front page with controls.
	o maybe: after login, you see the front page with login controls
		o welcome screen?
		o messages to posters? notes box in general?
-delete power allocated
-restricted sort functionality
-figure out how to seed database with images...
    *actually, you just need to transfer database content
-date form for articles: keep 2011-03-11 format?
    -What about the default value? Date.today.to_s => "2011-04-24"
    -How is the date entered? using f.date_select
-problematic article columns:
    -author (:text)
        -the current jdrampage site has the "by" included in the author field
        -the author field of the current site is actually a text area, not a text field
        solution:
        -rename this to credits, still of type :text;
        -new column author:string, which is actually shown in previews
        -credits, which includes the authors and their positions, is shown in the :show
        -*must be consistent for formality - provide example in view to remind posters
    -teaser (:text) - Definitely convert to :string! All teasers are short.
    -notes (:text) - Delete this
    -status  (:string) - Delete this
    -comments_allowed (:boolean) - Delete this
-design issues involving simple_format, the read >> link, and article previews
-deal with teasers (necessary? yes. one-liner strictly - note this in view)
-keep teasers b/c of tiny and small previews
-should change teaser:text to teaser:string
-users have images of their faces
