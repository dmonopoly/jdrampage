Online student newspaper for JDHS
Uses Rails 3.0.3

-TODO/Ideas-
Prioritized
-get the minimum of everything working
		-sort functionality within scope of section, so you can order articles within a section / most recent = 1st
				o accomplish this by creating a position_in_section:integer column in the articles table
				o a newly created article should have this variable be 0, +1 to others
    -sections show - automatically show most recent first
    -types of accounts:
        o see notes in dropbox
    -image upload
    -nice design (improve sidebar, look & feel, ckeditor, maybe remove :styles)
        o use content_for to clean up layout
    -free space for sections
        o get styles working

-only OLD articles in sidebars
-testing
-users have images of their faces
-sidebar reload AJAX
-comments

Unorganized
-decide what you want on the back home. For now, it is just a redundant front page with controls.
    o maybe: after login, you see the front page with login controls
        o welcome screen?
        o messages to posters? notes box in general?

Accomplished
-deal with subscribers
-pagination
	o for sections show, articles appear and it's all good.
	o consider some "show more" thing later so no sorting issues...
