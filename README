Important ideas:
Section names never change. Neither do free space names.

-TODO/Ideas-
Prioritized
-sorting problem: conflicts with paginate...
	o if you go to a page > 1 and sort, the section_positions get screwed up
	  b/c they're based on the indices in the array
	o You have fixed move_to_top_in_section :]
-date form for articles...

-figure out how to seed database with images...

-get the minimum of everything working
    -improve design even more
		o ckeditor (?), sidebar, text alignment, image upload
-only OLD articles in sidebars
-testing

Unorganized
-users have images of their faces
-sidebar reload AJAX
-comments

Accomplished
-deal with subscribers
-pagination
	o for sections show, articles appear and it is all good.
	o consider some "show more" thing later so no sorting issues...
-sort functionality within scope of section, so you can order articles within a section / most recent = 1st
	o accomplish this by creating a section_position:integer column in the articles table
	o a newly created article should have this variable be 1, +1 to others
-show most recent articles in sections first
-free space for sections
		o get styles working... only inline styles allowed, actually.
-nice design (improve sidebar, look & feel, ckeditor)
		o use content_for to clean up layout
		o sidebar for the back
-types of accounts:
    o see notes in dropbox. use cancan gem of ryanb
-decide what you want on the back home. For now, it is just a redundant front page with controls.
	o maybe: after login, you see the front page with login controls
		o welcome screen?
		o messages to posters? notes box in general?
-delete power allocated
-restricted sort functionality
