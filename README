Uses Rails 3.0.3

-TODO/Ideas-
Prioritized
-get the minimum of everything working
    -remove preview notion
        o remove admin/articles/show, make the show go to the front, add front controls
        o remove admin/pages/show, make the show go to the front, add front controls
        o add link to admin/sections/show to sections/show up front (conflicts with paginate...)
    -paginate for articles index, sections show
    -sections show - automatically show most recent first
    -types of accounts:
        o see notes in dropbox
    -image upload
    -deal with subscribers (see below)
    -nice design (improve sidebar, look & feel, ckeditor, maybe remove :styles)
-notification area on the back home - place to easily post messages, like "site will be undergoing changes at 3pm EST"
-free space for sections
-sort functionality within scope of section, so you can order articles within a section
-only OLD articles in sidebars
-change "backside and frontside" to "back and front"
-testing
-users have images of their faces
-sidebar reload AJAX
-comments

Unorganized
-names for subscribers; click button to send message to all subscribers, using their names (more personal)
-decide what you want on the back home. For now, it is just a redundant front page with controls.
    o maybe: after login, you see the front page with login controls
        o welcome screen?
        o messages to posters? notes box in general?
