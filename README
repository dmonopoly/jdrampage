-TODO/Ideas-
Prioritized
-get the minimum of everything working
    -paginate for articles index, sections show
        o actually, no paginate for articles index... just show 6 on front, all on back
            o have the 'show more' thing for articles index on the back
        o @articles in sections/show should paginate
    -sections show - automatically show most recent first
    -types of accounts:
        o see notes in dropbox
    -image upload
    -deal with subscribers
    -nice design (improve sidebar, look & feel, ckeditor, maybe remove :styles)
        o use content_for to clean up layout
-notification area on the back home - place to easily post messages, like "site will be undergoing changes at 3pm EST"
-free space for sections
-sort functionality within scope of section, so you can order articles within a section
-only OLD articles in sidebars
-testing
-users have images of their faces
-sidebar reload AJAX
-comments

Unorganized
-decide what you want on the back home. For now, it is just a redundant front page with controls.
    o maybe: after login, you see the front page with login controls
        o welcome screen?
        o messages to posters? notes box in general?
